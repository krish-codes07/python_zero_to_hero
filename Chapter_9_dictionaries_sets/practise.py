# practise question of dictionaries and sets 
# problem 1:create a program which acts as a dictionary for both hindi and english words and 
            #the user can look up to find meaning of different words 
# words = {
#     "help" : "madad",
#     "run" : "bhaago",
#     "play" : "khelo"
# }
# word = input("enter a word to check its meaning : ")
# print(words[word])

# problem 2: write a progam to take 8 input from user and display all the unique numbers once 
# numbers = set()
# for i in range(1,9):
#     numbers.add(int(input("enter a number - ")))  #type conversion important do not forget
# print(numbers)

# problem 3: can we have a set with 18 as int value and 18 as string value ?
# set = (18,"18")
# print(set)

# probem 4: check the length of the following
key = {18,"18",18.0}
print(type(key))
s= {}
print(type(s))
