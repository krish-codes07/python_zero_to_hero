# Chapter 3 – Input & Type Casting

## Overview
In this chapter, I learned how to take input from the user in Python and how to convert that input into different data types so that it can be used for calculations and logical decisions.

## Concepts Learned
- `input()` function is used to take input from the user
- `input()` always returns data in string format
- Type casting is required to convert input into `int` or `float`
- Basic use of `if / elif / else` for decision making
- Handling simple logical conditions in programs

## Files in This Chapter
- `user_input.py` – Basic usage of input() and printing user data
- `type_casting.py` – Converting input into int and float
- `practice.py` – Practice problems including user info and a simple calculator

## Common Mistakes
- Assuming input is numeric without type casting
- Using `bool(input())` for yes/no questions (logical error)
- Forgetting to handle division by zero
- Making logical mistakes that Python does not catch

## Key Takeaways
- User input must always be validated or converted before use
- Python does not prevent logical errors; the programmer must think carefully
- Proper input handling is essential for building reliable programs
